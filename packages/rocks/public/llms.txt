# AIt — Your Data. Your AI. One Conversation.

## What is AIt?

AIt is a personal AI assistant that connects to everything you use—your code repositories, music libraries, notes, tasks, and more—allowing you to interact with all your data through natural conversation.

Think of AIt as the bridge between your digital life and AI. Instead of switching between apps or searching through countless tools, you simply ask AIt.

## Key Benefits

- **Unified Access**: Connect GitHub, Spotify, Notion, Linear, and more in one place
- **Natural Conversations**: Ask questions about your data like you'd ask a friend
- **Personal Context**: AIt understands YOUR data, YOUR preferences, YOUR workflow
- **Privacy-First**: Your data stays yours—processed locally, owned by you

## The Vision

We believe AI should work for you, not the other way around. AIt brings the power of intelligent assistance to your personal ecosystem—making your scattered digital life feel whole again.

## Status

AIt is currently in development. We're crafting something extraordinary.
